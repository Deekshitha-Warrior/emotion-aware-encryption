EmpathyGuard 🔒❤️  
Emotion-Aware Encryption System – Protect your words, share your feelings

What is This Project?  
EmpathyGuard is like a smart diary that understands your feelings without reading your secrets!

Imagine this:  
- You write: "I'm so excited about my new job! 🎉 But a bit scared about the challenges... 😰"  
- EmpathyGuard encrypts it to: 9x@T!aZkP#13qWv$  
- AI can see: 😊 Joy + 😨 Fear  
- But CANNOT read your actual words  
- Only you can decrypt it back to the original message

How It Works (Simple Version)  
Step 1: Write Your Message 📝  
You type any message with feelings

Step 2: Magic Happens! ✨  
Action → What Happens  
Emotion Detection → AI reads your mood  
Encryption → Message becomes unreadable  
Emotion Output → Feelings stay visible

Step 3: Share Safely 🔐  
You Share → Others See  
Encrypted Code → 😊 Mood only  
Real Message → Hidden from view

Step 4: Decrypt When Needed 🔓  
Only you (with password) can read the original message

Why This is Useful  
For Students:  
😊 Teacher sees: "Student shows confusion + frustration"  
📚 But doesn't see: "I hate math homework, it's too hard!"  
→ Teacher can help without invading privacy!

For Families:  
❤️ Mom sees: "Child feeling lonely + happy"  
📱 But doesn't see: "No one played with me at school but I made a new friend!"  
→ Mom knows when to check in respectfully!

For Work:  
💼 Manager sees: "Team shows stress + satisfaction"  
📊 But doesn't see individual complaints  
→ Can improve workplace without monitoring chats!
